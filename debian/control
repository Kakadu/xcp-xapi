Description: Xen Cloud Platform - XenAPI server
 The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is a server virtualization and cloud
 computing platform, with support for a range of guest operating systems,
 including Linux network and storage support.
 .
 XCP addresses the needs of cloud providers, hosting services and data
 centers by combining the isolation and multitenancy capabilities of the
 Xen hypervisor with enhanced security, storage, and network
 virtualization technologies to offer a rich set of virtual infrastructure
 cloud services. The platform also addresses user requirements for
 security, availability, performance, and isolation across both private
 and public clouds.
 .
 XCP consolidates server workloads, and enables savings in power, cooling,
 and management costs. This improves reliability and adaptability in
 ever-changing IT environments, with optimized use of existing hardware,
 and contributes to environmentally sustainable computing.
 .
 This package contains the XenAPI server, which provides the control plane
 for XCP hosts and resource pools.

XenAPI python examples
----------------------

install.py
   -- chooses a Debian template and installs a VM from it, placing
      disks on the Pool's default SR. It adds a VIF connecting the VM
      to a network on the host and boots the VM. The script blocks until
      the guest agent has reported both the OS version and eth0's IP address.

powercycle.py
   -- lists all existing VMs, shuts them down and then performs some
      aggressive power-cycling on each one

vm_start_async.py
   -- demonstrates the asyncronous operation support by starting a VM
      named "new" (which must already exist and be halted), retrieving
      a task reference and displaying the instantaneous task status

watch-all-events.py
  -- demonstrates using the event system by registering for events on
     all classes and pretty-printing them as they are received.

shell.py
  -- creates a python interactive shell with access to the bindings for
     experimentation

Invoking the examples
---------------------

Each program takes 3 commandline arguments:

url - an https or http URL pointing at the server
username - a valid user on the server (eg root)
password

For example:

./install.py https://localhost:443/ root letmein

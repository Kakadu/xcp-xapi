<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>
   This README describes the Software Development Kit (SDK) for the
   XenServer 4.0 product family. The SDK provides programmatic
   access to the extensive set of XenServer management features and
   tools.

<h2>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>

   The SDK is provided in the form of a Xen Virtual Appliance (XVA).
   The XVA can be imported into XenServer 4.0 or above. In order to
   use the Windows CLI, you must first install the <a
   href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en">.NET Version
   2.0 runtime</a> on your Windows client system.

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING THE SDK</h2>

<ul>
     <li> Download the zip file and unzip it on your client system
       where you have XenCenter installed</li>

     <li> On the XenCenter File menu, click on "Import VM" and
       browse to the unzipped directory tree.</li>

     <li> Double-click on the "sdk" and then click OK.</li>

     <li>When the import has finished click on the "Network" tab of
       the XenVM and inspect the networking configuration. If the
       SDK is to be accessed remotely or you intend to run the
       examples to access a host system, then you must use XenCenter
       to add a network interface to the VM.  Once you have done
       this, the VM will attempt to acquire an IP address by DHCP
       each time it boots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>USING THE SDK</h2>
<ul>
     <li>Start the SDK VM (labelled in the UI as "XenServer SDK
       #.#.#-####") in XenCenter.</li>

     <li>On first boot the VM will prompt for a password for the
       "root" account. This password allows remote logins via SSH as
       well as via the Text Console in XenCenter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SDK CONTENT MAP</h2>

   The following is a overview of the contents of the /SDK directory
   tree. Where necessary, subdirectories have their own individual
   README files.
<pre>
 /SDK/README.txt

   This file

 /SDK/docs/pdf/xenenterpriseapi.pdf

   PDF reference for the API

 /SDK/docs/html/index.html

   html reference for the API

 /SDK/windows-cli

   CLI ('xe.exe') for Windows systems

 /SDK/client-examples/c

   C examples and a Makefile to build them

 /SDK/client-examples/c/test

   Test program

 /SDK/client-examples/csharp/XenSdk.net

   Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 solution which includes the C#
   language bindings (which compile to a .dll) and several example
   projects

 /SDK/client-examples/bash-cli

   Simple bash scripts which use the CLI ('xe')

 /SDK/client-examples/python

   Several example python programs
</pre>
<h2>BUILDING THE EXAMPLES</h2>

   The SDK VM comes complete with the tools necessary to build the C
   examples and also to run the bash scripts (which use the CLI) and
   the python programs. By contrast, the C# examples in
   <tt>/SDK/client-examples/csharp/XenSdk.net</tt> (<a href="/SDK/XenSdk.net.zip">zip</a>) must first be
   copied to a Windows machine with Visual Studio and .NET 2.0
   installed.

<h2>QUESTIONS AND FEEDBACK</h2>

   Please voice your questions and feedback about the SDK VM, as well
   as development issues, at <a href="http://community.citrix.com/cdn/xs">http://community.citrix.com/cdn/xs</a>.

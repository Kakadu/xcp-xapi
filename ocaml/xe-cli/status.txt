  vm-cd-remove

  vm-vif-remove

Some of the operations, particularly those that list things, return a somewhat
arbitrary set of information. I'll revisit these sometime soon and see whether
it needs fixing. If there's anything that anyone else notices that's missing,
superfluous or incorrect, let me know!

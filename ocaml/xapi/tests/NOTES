Changeset 499:
  Now that the HTTP server is running in single-threaded mode, all tests pass.
    (100000 VM.get_otherConfig via looper.py and 
       7000 Debug.recycle_int_float_map via looper2.py)
  When in multi-threaded mode, it invariably dies after about 100 connections
    with a "Bad file descriptor" error. Server keeps running though.
